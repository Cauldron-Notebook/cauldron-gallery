# Scatter Plots

Next we'll create scatter plots using the same Auto MPG dataset. This
this time we'll plot relationship between the horsepower (__hp__) and 
fuel economy (__mpg__) columns.

The first scatter plot shows this relationship. For the second scatter
plot, we've added per-point coloring, which represents the region of 
origin. We've also added per-point marker shapes representing the number
of cylinders.
