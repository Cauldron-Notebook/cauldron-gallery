# Bar Charts

Next we use the __cyl__ column from the dataset to plot a histogram of values. 
This column represents the number of cylinders in the engine of each 
automobile.

We create two bar plots. The first of which is a basic histogram. The second is
a little bit more advanced because it plots three histograms by grouping the 
cylinder counts by the region where the car was produced, which comes from the
__origin__ column. The origin regions are:

1. United States
2. Europe
3. Asia

Notice that the plots fill the width of the notebook window automatically.
