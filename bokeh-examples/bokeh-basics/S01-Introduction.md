# Bokeh: Basic Plotting

The following are examples of plotting with the Bokeh library inside a Cauldron
notebook. The plots will all use the 
[Auto MPG Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG)
which comes bundled in the bokeh library for convenience.

Plotting with Bokeh in Cauldron is straightforward. No initialization is 
required, and no magic methods need to be called for Bokeh to be used in a 
notebook context. Cauldron also automatically sizes the plots to fill the 
notebook display by default.
