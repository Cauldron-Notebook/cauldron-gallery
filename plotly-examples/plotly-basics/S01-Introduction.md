# Plotly: Basic Plotting

The following are examples of plotting with the Plotly library inside a Cauldron
notebook. The plots will all use the 
[Auto MPG Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) dataset.

Plotting with Plotly in Cauldron is straightforward. No initialization is 
required, and no magic methods need to be called for Plotly to be used in a 
notebook context. Cauldron also automatically sizes the plots to fill the 
notebook display by default.
