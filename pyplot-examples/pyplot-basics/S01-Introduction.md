# Pyplot: Basic Plotting

The following are examples of plotting with the PyPlot library inside a Cauldron
notebook. The plots will all use the 
[Auto MPG Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) dataset.

Plotting with PyPlot in Cauldron is straightforward. No initialization is 
required, and no magic methods need to be called for PyPlot to be used in a 
notebook context. Cauldron also automatically sizes the plots to fill the 
notebook display by default. The only additional requirement is to have
both `matplotlib` and `beauftifulSoup4` installed prior to working with
PyPlot inside of Cauldron notebook.
